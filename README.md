# Digit_recognizer_Kaggle
This repository contains all the datasets and the notebook files used for submitting the Kaggle digit recogniser competition.

For this purpose, we used a simple Artificial Neural Network to process the images.

The NPZ files required for the neural net have not been uploaded on this repository as the files are quite large.
